# brewasm
simple pic16 brewing application

This application is to enable me to relearn assembley language programming again, after years of bashing out c, c++ code and wallowing in the ide's of today a move back to vi and gpasm seems like a nice journey, perhaps with a bit of Zen thrown in.
The code base is mainly what I have learnt / found on the internet from piclist and others, thank you to all the people who take time out to pass their knowledge on and help me try to get my pale ale moving
My aim is to have a central control PIC16 where data is entered with remote nodes that actualy control the heaters etc, as the
project develops I will add eagle files etc and code experiments, as I say this is a project to help me get back into asm so the learning curve will be quite steep but hopefully interesting along the way.

I have chosen the PIC16f877a device for all the control functions, I appreciate it is now been replaced but I have a few to play with so decision made :) after all this is a recreation project.

Many Thanks to Tony Kubek for the project framework he has posted to the internet, Nigel Goodwin for his tutorials series with practical examples, A lot of the code methods presented by the two gentlemen above has found it's way into this project, so if you two are ever in this part of the world I would like to buy you a drink, or maybe taste some that I've brewed !
