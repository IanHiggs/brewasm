# brewasm
simple pic16 brewing application

This application is to enable me to relearn assembley language programming again, after years of bashing out c, c++ code aand wallowing in the ide's of today a move back to vi and mpasm seemed a nice move.
The code base is mainly what I have found on the internet from piclist and others, thank you to all the people who take time out to pass their knowledge on and help me try to get my pale ale moving..
My aim is to have a central control PIC16 where data is entered with remote nodes that actualy control the heaters etc, as the
project develops I will add eagle files etc and code experiments, as I say this is a project to help me get back into asm so the learning curve will be quite steep but hopefully interesting along the way.

I have chosen the PIC16f87a device for all the control functions, I appreciate it is now been replaced but I have a few to play with so decision made :) after all this is a recreation project.
